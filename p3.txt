turnin id:  aos_p3


Enhance the shell from p2 to support the new facilities described below.

Enhance the shell's capabilities with new support for handling signals so
that you can provide some job control.  For simplicity, assume:
    - there will be at most 4 processes to manage (foreground or suspended)
    - no process placed into the background will attempt to read from stdin

Operations/commands:

    ^Z on fg process suspends it
        Suspend the foreground process, but NOT the shell itself.

    jobs
        Builtin command to list current jobs (background / suspended).
        List each with a num beside it to be used in following commands.

    fg num
        Builtin command to cause the specified suspended or background
        process to become the foreground process.  In this context, the
        foreground process is merely the one on which the shell is hung
        waiting for it to complete.

    bg num
        Builtin command to cause the specified suspended process to
        run in the background.  The shell will not hang waiting for the
        process to complete since it is in the background.  However, the
        shell should still perform a wait operation to reap the SIGCHLD
        signal caused by termination of the process.  As stated above,
        no background process will attempt to read from stdin.


Submitting the project for grading:

The project should compile and link as p3.

You should turnin a tar file containing all of the required files.

To build the project, I will cd to my directory containing your files
and simply type:

    rm -rf p3
    rm -f *.o
    make
